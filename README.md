# Lavalamp
While working on my 2d shooter project, I was really facinated by the patterns the 'bullets' would make traveling across the screen. 
I wanted to explore this type of particle based simulation more so I started a side project: programming boids. 
While that project is not yet complete or published anywhere, a side side project which sprung off from that was this lava lamp. 

All the usuals, python, pygame needed to run. This isn't very optmised but it looks sorta cool. Also even though the particles are named 'boids' in the code, they really aren't. They only allign their direction and don't do the other two things boids are supposed to do.
