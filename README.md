# Boids & Lavalamps
While working on my 2d shooter project, I was really fascinated by the patterns the 'bullets' would make traveling across the screen. I wanted to explore this type of particle based simulation more so I started a side project: programming boids.

If you want to experiment with boids, run boids.py. All the relevant variables have been marked out in the code for you to change. I've already chosen some settings which I think look cool as a lava lamp, the code for that can be found in lavalamp.py

All the usuals, python, pygame needed to run. This isn't very optimized but it looks sorta cool.
